### Who am I?
Hello, I am Germano Barcelos, a Spatial Data Scientist and MSc in Computer Science.

My journey in Data Science began in 2019 when I joined into [NESPED-Lab](https://nesped.caf.ufv.br/) as an Undergradute Research to study about geospatial data enrichment. There I developed the package [MoreData](https://github.com/NESPEDUFV/more-data) which uses OpenStreetMap, Geopandas and others tools to provide an ease way to enrich data from different databases. In 2021, I participated in [GSoC](https://gist.github.com/gegen07/576dcdfad046cc91246bdb3ea3a47ce1) developing Spatial Optimization (Location Set Covering, P-Center, P-Median and Maximal Covering Set Models) models. When GSoC finished I joined into the developers team of PySAL which is the organization that I contributed for, specifically to [spopt](github.com/pysal/spopt) project. 

Since then, I have focused on combining geospatial analysis, machine learning, and network science to develop reproducible pipelines and scalable methods for understanding spatial dynamics in urban environments.
